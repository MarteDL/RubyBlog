# README

## What
This is a basic blog I created using Ruby on Rails for the very first time. I followed the [Getting Started with Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) guide step by step. It consists of a very basic CRUD, using MVC. The functionalities are all there but there is no styling done (yet).

## The Goal
Since I am starting an internship in a company that uses ROR in a few weeks, I wanted to already get acquinted with it. Coming from PHP I first followed the course on Ruby on [Sololearn](https://www.sololearn.com/learning/1081) but also wanted to check out some basic Rails functionalities before diving into my first bigger project. This guide was perfect for that.

## Things I learned
* How to install Rails, create a new Rails application, and connect your application to a database.
* The general layout of a Rails application.
* The basic principles of MVC (Model, View, Controller) and RESTful design (already had some experience with this though).
* How to quickly generate the starting pieces of a Rails application.

## Thoughts
Even though it is of course a lot of copy work, I learned a lot from this guide. It explains things quite well and gives you a chance to really see how to build a basic CRUD in Rails. Of course you can use the scaffold command to let Rails do this for you but I recommend everybody to first take a look at this guide. Coming from PHP it is interesting to see how much Ruby/Rails can do for you with its gazillion helper functions.
